ReactionGifs
============

Reaction Gifs is a simple, open-source gif picker for iOS, to demonstrate integration with the 2+ <a href="https://github.com/MobiSocialInc/GlueStick">GlueStick</a> utility. Installing this app allows you to open this app from within a 2+ chat. Selecting a gif automatically brings you back into your 2+ context, posting the gif to your chat.

Opening this app from the homescreen and selecting a gif results in copying that gif to the general iOS pasteboard for use in other apps. You are also presented with the option to share out to 2+, SMS, or Email.
